# Agent Task: Complete Jekyll Local Setup

## Quick Start for Agent

I need help finishing the Jekyll local development setup. Everything is documented in `JEKYLL_SETUP_STATUS.md`.

**Goal:** Get Jekyll running locally so I can test website changes on the `dev` branch.

**Current Issue:** Old `github-pages` gem incompatible with Ruby 3.4.7. Need to choose one of three solutions.

## What to Do

1. Read `JEKYLL_SETUP_STATUS.md` (has full details)
2. **Prefer Option 1** (conda environment) - user prefers conda/brew for isolation
3. Complete the setup
4. Test that `bundle exec jekyll serve` works
5. Report back with:
   - Which option you used
   - Any issues encountered
   - How to start the local server

## Context

- User is on macOS with Homebrew and Conda installed
- Working in `/Users/tserre/Projects/tserre.github.io` 
- On `dev` branch (safe for testing)
- User prefers isolated environments (conda/brew) to avoid system mess
- User is new to web dev, so keep explanations simple

## Files to Check

- `JEKYLL_SETUP_STATUS.md` - Full status and solutions
- `Gemfile` - Lists required gems
- `Gemfile.lock` - Currently updated to use Bundler 2.7.2

## Success Criteria

When done, user should be able to run:
```bash
cd /Users/tserre/Projects/tserre.github.io
bundle exec jekyll serve
# Opens at http://localhost:4000
```

Thank you!
