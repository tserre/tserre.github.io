> **Course Updates (Spring 2026):** This course has been substantially revamped for Spring 2026 to reflect rapid changes in NeuroAI. As a result, the schedule and specific activities may be adjusted during the semester. Updates will be posted on the course website. Thank you in advance for your flexibility and patience.

## Overview {#overview}

This course uses a lecture + lightning talk (conference style) format:

- **Tuesdays (80 min):** Instructor lecture introducing the week's theme (figure-first, conceptual approach)
- **Thursdays (80 min):** Student lightning talks (~15 presentations, 2 minutes each) + synthesis discussion

Students work in rotating small groups throughout the semester, culminating in project poster presentations. The course covers modern AI capabilities, explainable AI, the AI-neuroscience bridge, and cognitive alignment.

### Key Dates
- **First Class:** Thursday, January 22, 2026
- **Bootcamp:** Week 2 (async, conditional requirements)
- **Lightning Talks:** Weeks 3-9
- **Spring Break:** Week 10 (March 24-26)
- **Project Posters:** Weeks 11-12 (April 7-9)
- **Guest Lectures:** Weeks 13-14
- **Final Exam:** Tuesday, May 12, 2026, 9:00am

### Group & Presentation Plan (for up to 103 students)
- Lightning talks are prepared in small groups (typically 3, occasionally 4).
- Groups are not fixed: students will form new groups for each lightning week (rotating teams over the semester).
- Posters are reserved for student projects (after spring break).
- Equity: presentation turns are tracked at the individual student level so that each student presents the same number of times across the semester (lightning talks + the project poster).

## Schedule {#schedule}

### Week 1 — Course kickoff
<details>
<summary><strong>Thu 1/22 — Course Kickoff</strong></summary>
<p>NeuroAI goals, course structure, and how we will simulate scientific conferences (lightning talks and posters).</p>
<p><em>No readings or pre-class activities for Week 1—this is the introductory session.</em></p>
</details>

### Week 2 — Foundations of natural and artificial intelligence
<details markdown="1">
<summary><strong>Async Bootcamp (no in-person class this week)</strong></summary>

Goal: Put everyone on a leveled playing field for Week 3. Complete the Required Core first (mandatory for all), then the conditional tracks that match your background. You do *not* need to do every track.

*Note on access to papers:* For any *paper* link below, please use the Brown Library proxy links (you may be prompted to log in with Brown credentials off campus).

#### Required Core — Mandatory for all students

⚠️ Complete both items below before moving on to any conditional tracks. Students with a strong background in cognitive neuroscience may skim, but should still review to ensure familiarity with the course's framing and terminology.  
*Expected time: ~90 min total*

1. Marr's Levels of Analysis (video)  
<a href="https://nancysbraintalks.mit.edu/video_page/12-how-can-we-study-human-mind-and-brain-marrs-levels-analysis/" target="_blank">Nancy Kanwisher: "How Can We Study the Human Mind and Brain? Marr's Levels of Analysis"</a>

2. Coarse brain organization (video; focus on gross organization + functions)  
<a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/9-13-the-human-brain-spring-2019/resources/lecture-2-neuroanatomy/" target="_blank">MIT OCW 9.13 (Spring 2019) Lecture 2: "Neuroanatomy"</a>  
*Viewing guidance:* Watch for the high-level tour of major brain divisions/structures and what they do. Pay particular attention to concepts of receptive fields, neural tuning, and cortical maps — these are fundamental for understanding how neural networks relate to biological systems. You do *not* need to know fine anatomical details.

#### Conditional Track A — Cognitive neuroscience foundations
Complete this track if you have not taken at least 1–2 courses in neuroscience or cognitive neuroscience.  
Target time: up to ~180 min.

- **A1)** Neurons, spikes, firing rate (high-level; no ion-channel deep dive)  
<a href="https://www.brainfacts.org/core-concepts/how-neurons-communicate" target="_blank">BrainFacts: "How Neurons Communicate"</a>

- **A2)** Quick map of structures + functions  
<a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/public-education/brain-basics/brain-basics-know-your-brain" target="_blank">NIH/NINDS: "Brain Basics — Know Your Brain"</a>

- **A3)** Methods lectures (videos)
  - <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/9-13-the-human-brain-spring-2019/resources/lecture-4-cognitive-neuroscience-methods-i/" target="_blank">MIT OCW 9.13 Lecture 4: "Cognitive Neuroscience Methods I"</a>

  *Note:* Don't worry if the jargon feels overwhelming — you don't need to memorize all the details right now, and you can always come back to these videos later when these concepts become needed. These lectures include a section on Marr's levels of analysis; you can skip it if redundant with the required core, though reviewing it twice may be helpful if you haven't taken cognitive science courses.

- **A4)** Optional "what measures what?" cheat-sheets (short skims)

#### Conditional Track B — Linear algebra intuition (refresher)
Complete this track if vectors/matrices feel rusty.  
Target time: ~60 min total.

#### Conditional Track C — Deep learning intuition (refresher)
Complete this track if backprop/gradient descent are unfamiliar.  
Target time: ~60 min total.

- <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/neural-networks" target="_blank">3Blue1Brown: "What is a neural network?"</a>
- <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/gradient-descent" target="_blank">3Blue1Brown: "Gradient descent"</a>
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U" target="_blank">3Blue1Brown: "Backpropagation"</a>

#### Bootcamp Checkpoint (all students; due Sunday 2:00pm)

Purpose: Ensure everyone can (i) understand Marr’s Levels of Analysis, (ii) explain—in plain language—how an artificial neural network (ANN) learns from data, and (iii) identify how specific claims about brain or ANN function could be tested using neuroscience measurement techniques (e.g., what a method can or cannot reveal, and how experimental evidence could evaluate a model’s predictions).
