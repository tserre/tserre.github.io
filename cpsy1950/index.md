> **Course Updates (Spring 2026):** This course has been substantially revamped for Spring 2026 to reflect rapid changes in NeuroAI. As a result, the schedule and specific activities may be adjusted during the semester. Updates will be posted on the course website. Thank you in advance for your flexibility and patience.

## Overview {#overview}

This course uses a lecture + lightning talk (conference style) format:

- **Tuesdays (80 min):** Instructor lecture introducing the week's theme (figure-first, conceptual approach)
- **Thursdays (80 min):** Student lightning talks (~15 presentations, 2 minutes each) + synthesis discussion

Students work in rotating small groups throughout the semester, culminating in project poster presentations. The course covers modern AI capabilities, explainable AI, the AI-neuroscience bridge, and cognitive alignment.

### Key Dates
- **First Class:** Thursday, January 22, 2026
- **Bootcamp:** Week 2 (async, conditional requirements)
- **Lightning Talks:** Weeks 3-9
- **Spring Break:** Week 10 (March 24-26)
- **Project Posters:** Weeks 11-12 (April 7-9)
- **Guest Lectures:** Weeks 13-14
- **Final Exam:** Tuesday, May 12, 2026, 9:00am

### Group & Presentation Plan (for up to 103 students)
- Lightning talks are prepared in small groups (typically 3, occasionally 4).
- Groups are not fixed: students will form new groups for each lightning week (rotating teams over the semester).
- Posters are reserved for student projects (after spring break).
- Equity: presentation turns are tracked at the individual student level so that each student presents the same number of times across the semester (lightning talks + the project poster).

## Schedule {#schedule}

### Week 1 — Course kickoff
<details>
<summary><strong>Thu 1/22 — Course Kickoff</strong></summary>
<p>NeuroAI goals, course structure, and how we will simulate scientific conferences (lightning talks and posters).</p>
<p><em>No readings or pre-class activities for Week 1—this is the introductory session.</em></p>
</details>

### Week 2 — Async Bootcamp (no in-person class this week)
<details>
<summary><strong>Week 2 — Async Bootcamp</strong></summary>

Goal: Put everyone on a leveled playing field for Week 3. Complete the Required Core first (mandatory for all), then the conditional tracks that match your background. You do *not* need to do every track.

*Note on access to papers:* For any *paper* link below, please use the Brown Library proxy links (you may be prompted to log in with Brown credentials off campus).

#### Required Core — Mandatory for all students

⚠️ Complete both items below before moving on to any conditional tracks. Students with a strong background in cognitive neuroscience may skim, but should still review to ensure familiarity with the course's framing and terminology.  
*Expected time: ~90 min total*

1. Marr's Levels of Analysis (video)  
[Nancy Kanwisher: "How Can We Study the Human Mind and Brain? Marr's Levels of Analysis"](https://nancysbraintalks.mit.edu/video_page/12-how-can-we-study-human-mind-and-brain-marrs-levels-analysis/)

2. Coarse brain organization (video; focus on gross organization + functions)  
[MIT OCW 9.13 (Spring 2019) Lecture 2: "Neuroanatomy"](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/9-13-the-human-brain-spring-2019/resources/lecture-2-neuroanatomy/)  
*Viewing guidance:* Watch for the high-level tour of major brain divisions/structures and what they do. Pay particular attention to concepts of receptive fields, neural tuning, and cortical maps — these are fundamental for understanding how neural networks relate to biological systems. You do *not* need to know fine anatomical details.

#### Conditional Track A — Cognitive neuroscience foundations
Complete this track if you have not taken at least 1–2 courses in neuroscience or cognitive neuroscience.  
Target time: up to ~180 min.

- **A1)** Neurons, spikes, firing rate (high-level; no ion-channel deep dive)  
[BrainFacts: "How Neurons Communicate"](https://www.brainfacts.org/core-concepts/how-neurons-communicate)

- **A2)** Quick map of structures + functions  
[NIH/NINDS: "Brain Basics — Know Your Brain"](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/public-education/brain-basics/brain-basics-know-your-brain)

- **A3)** Methods lectures (videos)
  - [MIT OCW 9.13 Lecture 4: "Cognitive Neuroscience Methods I"](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/9-13-the-human-brain-spring-2019/resources/lecture-4-cognitive-neuroscience-methods-i/)
  - [MIT OCW 9.13 Lecture 5: "Cognitive Neuroscience Methods II"](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/9-13-the-human-brain-spring-2019/resources/lecture-5-cognitive-neuroscience-methods-ii/)
  
  *Note:* Don't worry if the jargon feels overwhelming — you don't need to memorize all the details right now, and you can always come back to these videos later when these concepts become needed. These lectures include a section on Marr's levels of analysis; you can skip it if redundant with the required core, though reviewing it twice may be helpful if you haven't taken cognitive science courses.

- **A4)** Optional "what measures what?" cheat-sheets (short skims)
  - [BrainFacts: "Measuring Neural Physiology"](https://www.brainfacts.org/in-the-lab/tools-and-techniques/2023/tools-for-physiology-022723)
  - [BrainFacts: "Viewing the Human Brain Through Noninvasive Tools"](https://www.brainfacts.org/in-the-lab/tools-and-techniques/2023/tools-used-for-human-research-030923)

#### Conditional Track B — Linear algebra intuition (refresher)
Complete this track if vectors/matrices feel rusty.  
Target time: ~60 min total.

- [3Blue1Brown: "Vectors, what even are they?"](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/vectors)
- [3Blue1Brown: "Linear combinations, span, and basis vectors"](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/span)
- [3Blue1Brown: "Linear transformations and matrices"](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/linear-transformations)
- [3Blue1Brown: "Matrix multiplication as composition"](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/matrix-multiplication)

#### Conditional Track C — Deep learning intuition (refresher)
Complete this track if backprop/gradient descent are unfamiliar.  
Target time: ~60 min total.

- [3Blue1Brown: "What is a neural network?"](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/neural-networks)
- [3Blue1Brown: "Gradient descent"](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/gradient-descent)
- [3Blue1Brown: "Backpropagation"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U)

#### Bootcamp Checkpoint (all students; due Sunday 2:00pm)

Purpose: Make sure everyone can (i) separate Marr levels, (ii) describe a simple ANN learning setup in plain language, and (iii) connect claims to what neuroscience measurements could test.

**Assigned paper** (skim; focus on the main question + 1–2 key figures):
