# CPSY 1950 — Course Overview (Spring 2026)

## Core format
- T/Th, 80 minutes
- Tue = lecture introducing the week's theme (conceptual, figure-first)
- Thu = lightning mini-conference on the same theme  
  - ~15 lightning talks (2:00 talk + 0:30 transition)  
  - ~20–30 min synthesis discussion/activity

## Group & presentation plan (for up to 103 students)
- Lightning talks are prepared in small groups (typically 3, occasionally 4).
- Groups are not fixed: students will form new groups for each lightning week (rotating teams over the semester).
- Posters are reserved for student projects (after spring break).
- Equity: presentation turns are tracked at the individual student level so that each student presents the same number of times across the semester (lightning talks + the project poster).

# Schedule
