Thomas Serre is the Thomas J. Watson, Sr. Professor of Science and Professor of Cognitive & Psychological Sciences and Computer Science at Brown University. He is the Faculty Director of the Center for Computation and Visualization and Associate Director of the Center for Computational Brain Science. He also holds an International Chair in AI within the Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute (France).

Dr. Serre received his Ph.D. in Neuroscience from MIT (2006) and MSc in EECS from Télécom Bretagne, France (2000). His research focuses on understanding neural computations supporting visual perception, with particular emphasis on the role of recurrent and feedback processes in visual reasoning. His work bridges neuroscience and artificial intelligence, developing brain-inspired computational models that have been featured in outlets including BBC, The Economist, New Scientist, and Scientific American.

Dr. Serre serves as area chair for top-tier conferences including CVPR, ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS, and as section editor for PLOS Computational Biology. He received an NSF Early Career Award and DARPA Young Faculty Award. His team's work on human action recognition earned the IEEE PAMI Helmholtz Prize (2021) and Mark Everingham Prize (2022).
