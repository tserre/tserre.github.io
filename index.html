Thomas Serre is the Thomas J. Watson, Sr. Professor of Science and Professor of <a href="https://brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences">Cognitive & Psychological Sciences</a> and <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/">Computer Science</a> at Brown University.<br>

He is the Faculty Director of the <a href="https://ccv.brown.edu/">Center for Computation and Visualization</a> and Associate Director of the <a href="https://ccbs.carney.brown.edu/">Center for Computational Brain Science</a>. He is also an affiliate faculty member of the <a href="https://brown.edu/academics/physics/centers/theoretical-physics-innovation">Brown Center for Theoretical Physics and Innovation</a> and the <a href="https://dsi.brown.edu/">Data Science Institute</a>. He also holds an International Chair in AI within the <a href="https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/">Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute (ANITI)</a> (France).<br>
Dr. Serre received his Ph.D. in Neuroscience from MIT (2006) and MSc in EECS from Télécom Bretagne, France (2000).<br>

His research focuses on understanding neural computations supporting visual perception, with particular emphasis on the role of recurrent and feedback processes in visual reasoning. His work bridges neuroscience and artificial intelligence, developing brain-inspired computational models that have been featured in outlets including BBC, The Economist, New Scientist, and Scientific American.<br>

Dr. Serre serves as area chair for top-tier conferences including CVPR, ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS, and as Neuroscience section editor for PLOS Computational Biology.<br>

He has received several awards, including the NSF Early Career Award, DARPA’s Young Faculty Award, and the Director's Award. Along with his team, he was awarded the 2021 PAMI Helmholtz Prize and the 2022 PAMI Mark Everingham Prize for their work on human action recognition. <br><br>

<h2>Research</h2>

My research investigates the computational principles of biological vision to understand how the brain works and to build more human-like AI systems. I work at the intersection of neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.<br><br>

<h3>Current Research Directions</h3>

<b>Human-AI Alignment in Vision</b><br>
We are developing methods to quantify and improve the alignment between deep neural networks and human visual processing. Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16940">recent work</a> reveals that despite impressive performance, current vision models process information fundamentally differently from humans—a gap crucial to understanding both for building more robust AI systems and for revealing brain mechanisms that support human vision. Our harmonization procedure demonstrates that alignment can be dramatically improved without changing network architectures, suggesting the misalignment stems not from structural limitations but from how these models are trained. This insight has led us to adopt a <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=KeiQNpb7sv">developmental psychology approach</a>, identifying the learning principles and developmental trajectories that shape human vision—principles we can incorporate into AI training to create models that not only perform well but genuinely see the world as humans do. <i>Funded by NSF</i><br><br>

<b>Cognitive Benchmarks for AI Visual Reasoning</b><br>
We develop rigorous cognitive-psychology-inspired tests to evaluate fundamental gaps between human and machine vision. Our benchmarks reveal systematic failures in modern AI: the <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2018/hash/ec8956637a99787bd197eacd77acce5e-Abstract.html">Pathfinder challenge</a> shows feedforward networks fail at contour integration that humans solve effortlessly—a test later adopted by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.04006">Google DeepMind</a>, who confirmed that even state-of-the-art transformers fail while our brain-inspired recurrent models succeed. Our <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/c08ee8fe3d19521f3bfa4102898329fd-Abstract-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.html">compositional reasoning benchmark</a> reveals AI's inability to flexibly combine visual concepts, while the <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=UIFAJZ22ZF">3D-PC benchmark</a> demonstrates failure at visual perspective-taking—a key signature of theory of mind. Even seemingly simple <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2018.0011">same-different judgments</a> expose how neural networks struggle with basic visual relationships—work that also helps identify <a href="https://www.eneuro.org/content/8/1/ENEURO.0267-20.2020">brain mechanisms underlying relational processing</a>. <i>Funded by ONR</i><br><br>

<b>Cortical Feedback and Visual Reasoning</b><br>
We are reverse-engineering how feedback connections in the brain enable complex visual reasoning and mental simulation. Our cognitive benchmarks reveal systematic failures of feedforward networks—from contour integration to relational judgments—suggesting precisely which computations require recurrent processing. These insights guide our experimental design: our <a href="https://www.eneuro.org/content/8/1/ENEURO.0267-20.2020">neurophysiology work</a> shows that same-different tasks that strain feedforward AI engage distinct neural dynamics in primates, while our <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)01380-0">recent studies</a> reveal that both monkeys and recurrent neural networks use internal "mental simulations" to solve challenging visual tasks. By identifying where feedforward processing fails, we can pinpoint the computational role of cortical feedback—work that is reshaping our understanding of how biological vision achieves robust reasoning through recurrence. <i>Funded by ONR</i><br><br>

<b>Explainable AI for Scientific Discovery</b><br>
In collaboration with the Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute, we're creating tools to understand and interpret deep learning models. Our <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Fel_CRAFT_Concept_Recursive_Activation_FacTorization_for_Explainability_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf">CRAFT framework</a> (Fel et al., CVPR 2023) and <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/76d2f8e328e1081c22a77ca0fa330ca5-Abstract-Conference.html">MACO approach</a> (Fel et al., NeurIPS 2023) help researchers peek inside the "black box" of AI. CRAFT provides concept-based explanations that reveal both "what" and "where" models look, while MACO unlocks feature visualization for state-of-the-art deep networks. These methods are implemented in our open-source <a href="https://github.com/deel-ai/xplique">Xplique toolbox</a>, making explainability accessible to the broader research community. Critically, our explainability tools reveal when AI learns <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/his.15180">deceptive strategies</a>—as we demonstrated in histopathology, where models claiming superhuman cancer diagnosis actually relied on spurious correlations rather than meaningful biological features. See these tools in action: <a href="https://serre-lab.github.io/Lens/">LENS</a> explains what ImageNet models really see, and <a href="https://serre-lab.github.io/LeafLens/">LeafLens</a> reveals how AI identifies plant species from cleared leaves. We're now developing methods to identify the computational mechanisms learned by foundation models—work outlined in our perspective on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17280">moving from prediction to understanding in brain science</a>. <i>Funded by ANR and NSF</i><br><br>
