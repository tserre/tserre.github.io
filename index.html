<h2>Research</h2>

My research investigates the computational principles of biological vision—both to understand how the brain works and to build more human-like AI systems. Working at the intersection of neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence, my lab tackles a fundamental question: How can we bridge the gap between biological and artificial vision to advance both brain science and AI?<br><br>

<h3>Current Research Directions</h3>

<b>Human-AI Alignment in Vision</b><br>
We develop methods to quantify and improve the alignment between deep neural networks and human visual processing. Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16940">recent work</a> reveals that despite impressive performance, current vision models process information fundamentally differently from humans—a critical gap for both building robust AI systems and understanding brain mechanisms. Importantly, our harmonization procedure shows that alignment can be dramatically improved without changing network architectures, suggesting the misalignment stems from training procedures rather than structural limitations. This insight has motivated us to adopt a <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=KeiQNpb7sv">developmental psychology approach</a>: we identify the learning principles and developmental trajectories that shape human vision, then incorporate these principles into AI training to create models that not only perform well but see the world as humans do. <i>Funded by NSF.</i><br><br>

<b>Cognitive Benchmarks for AI Visual Reasoning</b><br>
We develop rigorous cognitive-psychology-inspired benchmarks to evaluate fundamental gaps between human and machine vision. These benchmarks reveal systematic failures in modern AI. For example, our <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2018/hash/ec8956637a99787bd197eacd77acce5e-Abstract.html">Pathfinder challenge</a> shows that feedforward networks fail at contour integration tasks that humans solve effortlessly—a finding later confirmed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.04006">Google DeepMind</a>, who showed that even state-of-the-art transformers fail while our brain-inspired recurrent models succeed. Our <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/c08ee8fe3d19521f3bfa4102898329fd-Abstract-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.html">compositional reasoning benchmark</a> reveals AI's inability to flexibly combine visual concepts, while our <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=UIFAJZ22ZF">3D-PC benchmark</a> demonstrates failures in visual perspective-taking—a key signature of theory of mind. Even seemingly simple <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2018.0011">same-different judgments</a> expose how neural networks struggle with basic visual relationships. Critically, this work not only reveals AI limitations but also helps identify <a href="https://www.eneuro.org/content/8/1/ENEURO.0267-20.2020">brain mechanisms underlying relational processing</a>. <i>Funded by ONR.</i><br><br>

<b>Cortical Feedback and Visual Reasoning</b><br>
We reverse-engineer how feedback connections in the brain enable complex visual reasoning and mental simulation. Our cognitive benchmarks reveal systematic failures of feedforward networks—from contour integration to relational judgments—pinpointing which computations require recurrent processing. These insights guide our experimental work: our <a href="https://www.eneuro.org/content/8/1/ENEURO.0267-20.2020">neurophysiology studies</a> show that same-different tasks that challenge feedforward AI engage distinct neural dynamics in primates, while our <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)01380-0">recent work</a> reveals that both monkeys and recurrent neural networks use internal "mental simulations" to solve challenging visual tasks. By identifying where feedforward processing fails, we pinpoint the computational role of cortical feedback. This work is reshaping our understanding of how biological vision achieves robust reasoning through recurrent processing. <i>Funded by ONR.</i><br><br>

<b>Explainable AI for Scientific Discovery</b><br>
In collaboration with the Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute, we create tools to understand and interpret deep learning models. Our <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Fel_CRAFT_Concept_Recursive_Activation_FacTorization_for_Explainability_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf">CRAFT framework</a> and <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/76d2f8e328e1081c22a77ca0fa330ca5-Abstract-Conference.html">MACO approach</a> help researchers open the "black box" of AI. CRAFT provides concept-based explanations revealing both "what" and "where" models look, while MACO enables feature visualization for state-of-the-art deep networks. These methods are implemented in our open-source <a href="https://github.com/deel-ai/xplique">Xplique toolbox</a>, making explainability accessible to the broader research community. Critically, our tools reveal when AI learns <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/his.15180">deceptive strategies</a>—for instance, in histopathology, we showed that models claiming superhuman cancer diagnosis actually relied on spurious correlations rather than meaningful biological features. See these tools in action: <a href="https://serre-lab.github.io/Lens/">LENS</a> explains what ImageNet models actually see, and <a href="https://serre-lab.github.io/LeafLens/">LeafLens</a> reveals how AI identifies plant species from cleared leaves. Building on this work, we are developing methods to identify computational mechanisms learned by foundation models—an effort outlined in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17280">perspective on moving from prediction to understanding in brain science</a>. <i>Funded by ANR and NSF.</i><br><br>
